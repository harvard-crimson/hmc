                        <p>Perched sixteen stories above street level in the Boston Federal Reserve Building, the office of Jane L. Mendillo offers majestic views of boats bobbing in Boston Harbor and planes touching down at Logan Airport. Sitting two levels above a bustling trading floor, Mendillo not only occupies one of the nicest offices at Harvard but, as CEO of Harvard Management Company, influences the University’s financial strength more than even the most celebrated Harvard donors. </p>
                        <p>At HMC, the stakes are high. Tasked with managing the largest endowment in higher education—valued at $32.7 billion as of July 2013—HMC’s managers operate with the knowledge that even the smallest margins translate to millions of dollars. To put it another way: a difference of a single percent in annual returns at HMC represents an amount—nearly $330 million—that is more than twice the size of the largest gift announced so far in the University’s record-seeking capital

                            <div class="context-quote-body">&ldquo;Founded in 1974, Harvard Management Company invests a significant portion of Harvard’s endowment with an in-house team of traders and managers based in the Boston Federal Reserve Building. HMC prides itself on being able to take positions in asset classes like private equity, natural resources, and real estate that may not be as accessible to smaller, externally-managed funds and which thus have the potential to generate an increased payout. &rdquo;</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Mendillo has been credited with helping stave off disaster during the nadir of the global financial crisis in 2009, when HMC saw endowment returns of negative 27.3 percent. Each day during the recession, Mendillo convened her senior staff for a 7 a.m. crisis meeting. Today, with the meltdown in the rearview mirror, those meetings have ceased, and the endowment has started to recover. Although the fund is nearly $7 billion stronger than it was in 2009, Mendillo says the pressure of managing such a large endowment is constant.
                        </p> 

                        <p>“It’s an extra challenge,” she said in her office in mid-May. “It’s a huge responsibility.” 
                        </p> 

                        <p>Yet since the crisis, HMC—in a shift away from record yields in the 1990s and early 2000s—has posted returns that have straddled the national average. In this new normal, a far cry from HMC’s early-2000s status as the envy of higher education, University leaders say HMC is fulfilling its charge of beating internally set benchmarks and holding more liquid assets in case another crisis hits. But as Harvard seeks to raise an ambitious $6.5 billion in its ongoing capital campaign, the numbers do not lie: HMC is not performing as well as it used to.

                        <h2 class="pt-serif">THE GOLDEN YEARS: JACK MEYER AND THE ‘YALE MODEL’ </h2>
                        <p>Today, HMC is closer to average than it has been in a long time. In two of the last four fiscal years, the company has posted returns that have trailed the average reported by the National Association of College and University Business Officers—an organization that conducts an annual survey that included more than 800 schools in 2013. In three of these years, moreover, HMC has performed below the national average for endowments worth more than $1 billion. </p> 

                        <p>HMC has also lagged behind other large endowments in recent years. In FY 2012, Yale posted a return of 4.7 percent, outpacing Harvard, which returned -.05 percent. Princeton was also in the black in FY 2012, returning 3.1 percent. And last fiscal year, Yale, Stanford and Princeton each posted higher returns than HMC. </p> 

                        <p>It was not always this way. HMC under the leadership of CEO Jack R. Meyer beat the general NACUBO average each year between 1996 and and 2005, emerging with Yale as one of the nation’s most rapidly growing endowments. During the same span, Meyer’s HMC only underperformed against the $1 billion plus average twice. </p> 

                        <p>When Meyer arrived at HMC in 1990, he inherited a fledgling company designed to shepherd the investments of an endowment worth $4.7 billion. Over the next 14 fiscal years, Meyer more than tripled that figure, attaining celebrity status with University leaders and supporters. When he left his post in 2005, the endowment had grown to $25.9 billion. </p> 

                        <div class="context-quote-wrapper context-quote-right">
                        <div class="context-quote">
                            <div class="context-quote-trigger"></div>
                            <div class="context-quote-body">&ldquo;Jack R. Meyer led HMC from 1990 until September 2005, increasing the size of the endowment more than five times over and leaving it with a value of $25.9 billion. Though he approached celebrity status with some prominent University donors and leaders, Meyer sparked a controversy with the lavish sums he paid his top managers, who could earn more than $30 million in a single year. Meyer was so instrumental to Harvard’s endowment management that some thought that his departure would spell the end of Harvard investing the endowment with through an in-house arm. &rdquo;</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Like his predecessor Walter M. Cabot ’55—who took office in 1974 as HMC’s founding CEO—Meyer invested in line with what is known as the “Yale endowment model” developed by Yale Chief Investment Officer David F. Swensen, channeling the endowment into a range of alternative asset classes such as private equity and real estate rather than a more traditional mix of domestic stocks and bonds. </p> 

                        <p>An especially lucrative asset class under Meyer’s reign was private equity, investments in firms that purchase and restructure private companies for eventual sale. Between 1997 and 2007, HMC’s private equity investments generated annualized returns in excess of 30 percent.</p>  

                        <p>When the Yale model works, these alternative asset classes bring investors the potential for elevated returns at the expense of liquidity, meaning the investments—while perhaps more profitable—are not nearly as easy to unload as typical stock-bond portfolios. </p> 

                        <p>The focus on alternative assets like private equity was so successful between 1997 and 2007 in part because it gave endowments like those of Harvard and Yale a distinct comparative advantage. Because of the value of Harvard’s endowment, HMC was able to gain access to private equity firms that might not have allowed smaller funds to participate. This access was only accentuated, for both Harvard and Yale, by the concentration of the schools’ alumni in private equity.</p> 

                        <p>“I don’t think it’s ever going to be true that most of the good managers on Wall Street are from any place other than Harvard,” said David L. Yermack ’85, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “Because of that, the University is going to get access and information that just isn’t going to be duplicated by any other competitor, and that’s a fairly timeless advantage that works very much in Harvard’s favor.”</p> 

                        <p>For a time, then, HMC and a few other large endowments were the first guests at a very lucrative party. But the comparative advantage eventually subsided, as other funds seized on private equity and other aspects of HMC’s winning strategy. In the last 10 years, HMC’s private equity assets have yielded an annualized return of slightly over 9 percent, a fraction of the 30 percent returns the company reaped from that class of assets during the peak of its growth. </p> 

                        <p>But HMC is not running away from private equity. In fact, since FY 2008, it has increased its target allocation to the asset class from 11 percent to 16 percent, according to HMC’s FY 2013 annual report. </p> 

                        <p>“We still like the asset class, but the expectations need to be somewhat muted,” Mendillo said in her office in May, adding that given the increasingly crowded nature of the asset class, it will be difficult to replicate the private equity premium that fueled the endowment for the past 20 years. </p> 

                        <p>Despite Mendillo’s caution, HMC’s persistence in private equity has some experts perplexed.</p> 

                        <p>“You can’t keep going back to the same playbook because competition and the entry of competitors bid away the returns,” Yermack said.</p>

                        <h2 class="pt-serif">PICKING BATTLES</h2>
                        <p>Sitting in his second-floor office of the Maxwell Dworkin building, in the heart of Harvard&#39;s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Morrisett pointed across his office to the large Apple computer sitting on his desk.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;It could get hacked, I&#39;m sure, pretty easily,&rdquo; said the chair of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Standing Committee on IT, who is also a member of Microsoft&#39;s Research Technical Advisory Board, as well as the Intel/Berkeley Science and Technology Center for Secure Computing Advising Board.</p>
                        <p>Morrisett, perhaps unsurpassed in cyber-security expertise at Harvard, recognized &ldquo;the futility of modern firewalls and other kinds of border defenses.&rdquo; He noted that a hypothetical targeted attack by the Chinese or the National Security Agency, for instance, could easily access his machine.</p>
                        <p>Unlike a typical corporation, where management can impose top-down regulations on computer security, Harvard must grapple with the University&#39;s professed dedication to&mdash;and faculty&#39;s insistence on&mdash;an open flow of information.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;HUIT must contend with the fact that a university is meant to be a fundamentally open place, and a churn of new students and community members coming in, along with the mismatch of paranoid security practices (such as special twofactor security keys) to that openness, means that
                        the University must strike balances that private sector companies need not worry about as much,&rdquo; Harvard Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain wrote in an email.</p>
                        <p>According to Morrisett, this distinction signifies one of the key differences between Harvard&#39;s fight against cyberattacks and that of private sector companies. While a business executive might be unable to access company data from home or abroad, professors generally have free reign over where and how they interact with their research.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We&#39;re open as much as we can be,&rdquo; Morrisett said. &ldquo;The whole idea is to make information available. And so we can&#39;t afford to put everything behind a big giant firewall and impose dramatic security conditions....It just wouldn&#39;t work.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Hamer agreed, saying that HUIT keeps those principles in mind. &ldquo;In some corporate environments, it&#39;s easy to be very controls-focused and come up with a big list of things that people are not supposed to do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&#39;s not something that works well here, nor should it. It means we have to be more collaborative with folks and work with them and look at this as a shared responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The very nature of a university requires that control over information cannot be exclusive to one office, or even the entire administration. &ldquo;I don&#39;t believe there is any one person who brings the hammer down and says this is how we are going to do business,&rdquo; Tumin said. &ldquo;A university is essentially comprised of a faculty of scholars who must be involved in these kinds of deliberation.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>In many ways, Harvard&#39;s open research philosophy of publication means that professors are less worried about cyberattacks that target research, particularly given the security measures already taken&mdash;however basic they may be.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;We are mostly interested in sharing our data, so we&#39;re not actually concerned about information being taken,&rdquo; astronomy professor Charles R. Alcock said. &ldquo;There is some concern over someone going in there and corrupting the data. As long as there is good or even reasonable firewall protection, we feel fairly secure.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Mitzi I. Kuroda, a professor at Harvard School of Public Health, said that she had never considered the possibility of an outside attacker breaking into her computer and accessing her research data.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;I guess it never really occurred to me that someone could make enough out of what we have in all of our files to reconstruct something useful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So far we feel safe. In basic research, it hasn&#39;t been a big issue for us.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>The existing security precautions taken by Harvard&#39;s administrators interfere very little with the user experience, according to several professors. &ldquo;Cybersecurity has not actually been much of an impediment to our research,&rdquo; said Alcock, who frequently uses large data sets accessed online. &ldquo;The ordinary institutional protections are adequate for our needs and have not really gotten in our way.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Yet this lack of intense security oversight by the administration may leave individual computers more susceptible to attacks from the outside world. According to Morrisett, &ldquo;Universities are target-rich environments because they&#39;re not so locked down and a lot of students&#39; [computers] can be owned rather surreptitiously, and that leads to a problem.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Given the decentralization of Harvard&#39;s information technology, Hamer said that individual community members must work together to protect the system. &ldquo;Theres no one technical control or big thing we can throw at it; we all have to work on it together,&ldquo; Hamer said.</p>
                        <p>As attacks become more sophisticated, however, HUIT may be forced to implement more rigorous security measures to protect the entire system from the vulnerabilities of a single computer. Any step taken to combat potential attacks must be weighed in the context of Harvard&#39;s greater mission as an institution of higher education.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;This place should be open, and if security&#39;s getting in the way of me teaching, or you guys studying or doing whatever you want, then it&#39;s bad,&rdquo; Morrisett said. &ldquo;And I worry that we&#39;re swinging too much towards taking bureaucratic steps for compliance that don&#39;t really address real problems and yet get in the way of usability of the systems.&rdquo;</p>
